          Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the existence
          of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly

          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
          Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
          far beyond the world of known physics.

          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
          particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
          discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
          potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
          infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
          force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light
          for a prodigiously violent instant.

          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
          heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
          mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
          irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
          beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.

          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
          that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
          hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

          Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic
          time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led by
          John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
          detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational
          waves — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart
          when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a
          second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of
          inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was
          correct.
        </p>
        <p class="article-text">
          Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
          many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
          <br />
          If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science
          comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe
          apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast realms of time
          and space and energy to science and speculation.
          <br />
          Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14
          billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of
          galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
          extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own
          universe there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling
          into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
          operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle
          accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr.
          Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational
          waves, which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity,
          should ruffle space-time.
          <br />
          Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
          expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big as it
          gets.”
          <br />
          He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
          sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
          <br />
          The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath
          of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a picture of
          the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the surface
          of the sun.
          <br />
          Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as
          Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
          reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
          Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
          Astrophysical Journal.

            THE UNIVERSE is just under 14 billion years old. From our position
            in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere that is now about
            92 billion light-years across. But there's a mystery. Wherever we
            look, the universe has an even temperature.

          <p class="tiny-info-text tiny-info-2">
            NOT ENOUGH TIME The universe is not old enough for light to have
            traveled the vast distance from one side of the universe to the
            other, and there has not been enough time for scattered patches of
            hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.

          <p class="tiny-info-text tiny-info-3">
            DISTANT COFFEE At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope to look
            a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from the amount
            of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how much it has
            cooled.
          </p>
          <p class="tiny-info-text tiny-info-4">
            COFFEE EVERYWHERE Now turn around and look a mile in the other
            direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same
            temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup in
            every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.
          </p>
          <p class="tiny-info-text tiny-info-5">
            STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME There has not been enough time to carry coffee
            cups from place to place before they get cold. But if all the coffee
            cups were somehow filled from a single coffee pot, all at the same
            time, that might explain their even temperature.
          </p>
          <p class="tiny-info-text tiny-info-6">
            INFLATION solves this problem. The theory proposes that, less than a
            trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the universe expanded
            faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples in the violently
            expanding energy field eventually grew into the large-scale
            structures of the universe.
          </p>
          <p class="tiny-info-text tiny-info-7">
            FLUCTUATION Astronomers have now detected evidence of these ancient
            fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in the cosmic background
            radiation, which is energy left over from the early universe. These
            are gravitational waves predicted by Einstein.

            EXPANSION Returning to our coffee, imagine a single, central pot
            expanding faster than light and cooling to an even temperature as it
            expands. That is something like inflation. And the structure of the
            universe mirrors the froth and foam of the original pot.
